### Linux scripts

- `play-video.sh`
 FZF-based video picker that opens files in mpv

- `custom-powermenu.sh`
 Hyprland power menu with lock, suspend, reboot options 

I also unbinded a key today and learned that my power menu is linked with system by default and cant be change via config, so i created a new script all together.

- `brightness.sh`
 Helps in adjusting with screen brightness using  CLI 
 'brightness up' for increasing screen brightness
 'brightness down' for decreasing screen brightness

- `Updated Mpv config`
 Mpv now resumes videos from where it was left off

- Uploading my all configs of waybar
 I am thinking of experimenting a lot, that is why i am uploading on github as a safety net.
