### Linux scripts

- `play-video.sh`
 FZF-based video picker that opens files in mpv

-`custom-powermenu.sh`
 Hyprland power menu with lock, suspend, reboot options 

I also unbinded a key today and learned that my power menu is linked with system by default and cant be change via config, so i created a new script all together.
